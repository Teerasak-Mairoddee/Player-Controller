# 2D Dark Souls!
By paying homage to my love for combat and timing, I have developed a playable character that can menouver similarly to all the games I love.

# Mechanics
1) Walking Left and Right
2) Rolling Left and Right
3) Jumping (Can dodge attacks)
4) Sword Striking
5) Parrying (Timed Block)
6) Taking damage (No penalty in this project)

# Key Aspects
1) Hit Boxes - Making sure all hitboxes had essential roles to play. Many games utilise hitboxes to determine a more complex level of accuracy.
2) Timing - Timing is everything. Hardcore games like the Soul's series and the likes of For Honor require timings by the millisecond which have influenced my own parry timings.
3) Scalablilty - The options moving forward are endless. Could be easily converted into a quick reaction based mobile game. The main visoion was a Couch Co-Op story platformer.

# Why?
My Other roommate who is currently taking a Comp Sci degree came to me with a suggestion to make a game together.
He knew only how to code algorithms rather than how to apply code logic to program games. I used this as a project to teach him the basics of unity and progressed the lesson into a more complex project.

# Disclaimer
The entire game project including assets will be in this Repo.
A free asset was used (Hero Knight). Animations were from this asset Unity Asset store.
A prebuilt player controller may be in the prefabs list (this is not my work).
<b>My Codes are in the Player Scripts Folder & AI Scripts folder.<b>
